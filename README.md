# Respawn_and_Checkpoints

Controls: Left and right to move, space to jump, and X to save at a checkpoint. Touch the black bar at the bottom to trigger a respawn.

Checkpoints: 
Animation1: Before first save/cat in catbed
Animation2: During first save/cat leaving catbed
Animation3: After first save/empty catbed

Player:
Animation1: First save at a checkpoint/interact with catbed with cat
Animation2: Subsequent save at a checkpoint/interact with catbed without cat

The movement in the executable and the game scece of the Unity project work quite differently on my computer, idk why that is, movement isn't my job right now lol.
